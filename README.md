# About this doc
This repository is meant to be containing all the information needed by a DAO to start onboarding community members.  

# Questions that this repository answers
1) When you say member participaton what do you mean by that? 
2) I would say before we put tasks on a task board, how can the DAO needs to solve people being able to articulate what the DAO needs
3) How would you make sure once a task has been finished rest of the DAO knows that is has been finshed and does not need to be worked on anymore 
4) Who would be the one making sure a same task does not get worked on twice (Say in a 2 months the same task is on this list again)
5) Who communicates results to the rest of the DAO
6) Who maintains this system of generating tasks, making sure they are relevant, have not dependency are not time bound etc.
